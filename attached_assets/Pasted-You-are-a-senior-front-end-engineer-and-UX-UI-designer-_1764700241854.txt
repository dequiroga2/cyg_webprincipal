You are a senior front-end engineer and UX/UI designer.

Build a **single-page, responsive landing page** for a company called **“C&G CORP”**.  
C&G CORP is a **VPO (Voice Process Outsourcing) company** that offers **AI phone agents** for enterprise call centers. The goal is to show that our AI agents reduce operating costs while improving customer experience.

### General style & references
- Visual inspiration: structure and tone similar to **yoummday** (modern outsourcing / BPO site) and the **Konecta** homepage for the hero animation and minimal layout.
- The page must feel premium, technological and trustworthy.
- Use a **dark background** with a lot of negative space and strong typography.

### Color palette
Use only these colors (you may define them as CSS variables):
- Primary background: `#140d4f`
- Text: `white`
- Accent: **rose gold** (use a metallic rose-gold color similar to `#b76e79` for buttons, borders and highlights).

### Layout & sections
Create a fixed, transparent top navigation bar that becomes solid after scrolling.

Menu items (in this exact order, aligned to the right):
1. **About Us**
2. **Solutions**
3. **Industries**
4. **Regulations & Compliance**
5. **News & Insights**

When the user clicks each item, smoothly scroll to the corresponding section.

Sections on the single page:
1. **Hero section (full viewport height)**
   - Dark `#140d4f` background.
   - Centered animated logo concept inspired by Konecta’s intro:
     - Start with a **large abstract, flowing ribbon shape** (like a curved “wave”) in the center of the screen.
     - Inside that ribbon, show a masked slideshow or subtle video of **call centers, people with headsets, analytics dashboards, AI visualizations**, etc.
     - Animate the ribbon so that it **shrinks and moves to the center**, gradually transforming into a clean, static **C&G CORP wordmark** in rose gold (you can build this using SVG, clip-path, or CSS animations – it doesn’t need to be identical to Konecta, just a similar idea of “shape with images that becomes the logo”).
   - Under the final logo, show the tagline in white, for example:
     - “AI voice agents that transform your call center.”
   - Add 1–2 call-to-action buttons:
     - “Book a demo”
     - “Talk to our team”
   - Include a small **scroll indicator** (a mouse icon with a down arrow) centered at the bottom of the hero to invite scrolling.

2. **About Us**
   - Short paragraph describing C&G CORP as a VPO company with AI call agents that reduce costs and improve efficiency.
   - 3 small columns/cards with key values (e.g., “Cost Optimization”, “Customer Experience”, “Scalable AI”), with icons or simple illustrations (use placeholders).

3. **Solutions**
   - A grid of cards describing different AI call solutions (e.g., “Inbound Support Agent”, “Outbound Collections Agent”, “Appointment Scheduling Agent”, “24/7 Virtual Receptionist”).
   - Each card: icon or image placeholder, title, short description, and a small “Learn more” link.
   - Use rose-gold accents on hover (borders, shadows or underlines).

4. **Industries**
   - Section title and short intro line.
   - A responsive grid of industry tiles: e.g., “Telecom”, “Financial Services”, “Healthcare”, “E-commerce & Retail”, “Utilities”, etc.
   - Each tile with a subtle hover effect (scale + border in rose gold).

5. **Regulations & Compliance**
   - Content must be written in **English**.
   - Explain (with placeholder text) that C&G CORP helps clients comply with key regulations (e.g., data protection, security, quality standards).
   - Create a 3-column layout with cards titled “Data Protection”, “Security & Reliability”, and “Quality & Monitoring”.
   - Under each card, use placeholder bullet points such as “GDPR-ready processes”, “Secure infrastructure”, “Call recording & QA tooling”, etc. (real text is not critical; it will be replaced later).

6. **News & Insights**
   - A simple 3-column blog/news grid with cards that include:
     - Image placeholder
     - Title
     - Short teaser text
     - “Read more” link
   - This section should look like a modern blog section.

7. **Footer**
   - Dark `#140d4f` background.
   - Include:
     - C&G CORP logo or text mark.
     - Placeholder address.
     - Social media icon placeholders.
     - Small links: “Privacy Policy”, “Terms of Service”, “Contact”.

### Technical requirements
- Use **semantic HTML5**, **modern CSS (Flexbox & Grid)**, and vanilla **JavaScript** (no frameworks are strictly required).
- Organize the project into:
  - `index.html`
  - `styles.css`
  - `script.js`
- Implement:
  - Smooth scrolling for nav links.
  - Sticky navigation that changes background color after scrolling past the hero.
  - Basic responsive behavior for mobile (hamburger menu or collapsing navigation, stack columns vertically, adjust hero typography).
- Fill all texts and image URLs with **clear placeholder content** related to AI call agents and BPO; I will replace them manually later.

Please generate all the code needed and ensure it runs directly in the browser inside Replit.
